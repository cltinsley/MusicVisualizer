This is a passive listening sound visualizer that takes input from the computer's microphone to create a shape and colors that correspond to the sounds it hears.

The main application is visualizing music, as the colors will change according to the loudness (volume) of a song, and the shape will change according to the frequency of the song being played.

This program relies heavily on the p5.js library for creating shapes and getting the audio properties from the mic.

The program can be found on github pages at: https://cltinsley.github.io/MusicVisualizer/


To use the code yourself, run the it on a localhost. Steps are shown below.
1. Change directory (cd) to music visualizer directory

2. Run on command line: python -m SimpleHTTPServer [nnnn]
   - [nnnn] is optional and specifies server name (8000 default)

3. Go to http://localhost:8000/ on a browser
